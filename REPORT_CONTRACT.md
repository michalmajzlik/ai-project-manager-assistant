# PM AI Assistant - Report Contract v1

## 1) Scope and Data Sources

### In scope reports
1. Daily Client Standup - structured text
2. Weekly Project Status (internal management) - structured text
3. Steering Committee Pack (client + internal senior management) - presentation

### Primary data sources
1. Jira (project, issues, releases, statuses, assignees, estimates, spent, chargeable)
2. Meeting transcripts
3. Calendar events
4. Emails

### Output language
- All outputs in English.

## 2) Shared Decision Logic

### RAG model (heuristic v1, to be refined later)
- Green:
  - No active critical blocker
  - Release confidence >= 80%
  - No major dependency at risk in next 7 days
- Amber:
  - 1 significant blocker or dependency risk
  - Release confidence 60-79%
  - Noticeable slippage risk but still recoverable
- Red:
  - Multiple blockers or unresolved critical path issue
  - Release confidence < 60%
  - High probability of milestone miss or unresolved escalation

### Capacity management model (v1)
- Unit: MD (man-days)
- Reporting dimensions:
  1. Planned MD vs. consumed MD
  2. Remaining MD
  3. MD by assignee/team
  4. MD concentration risk (single-point overload)

### Billing model (v1)
- Source: Jira standard task level
- Count only issues where:
  1. `Chargeable = True`
  2. `Actual spent` is present
- Billing summary includes:
  1. Total chargeable effort
  2. Non-chargeable effort
  3. Missing/invalid billing data flags

3. Release readiness summary
4. Budget/billing snapshot
5. Decisions required
6. Next period priorities

### Format
- Presentation deck + concise speaker notes

## 4) Scheduling and Deadlines (Release-driven)

### Rule
- Planned releases are discovered from Jira release objects for project scope.
- For each unreleased release with a defined `releaseDate`, create release-day reporting output aligned to that date.

### v1 scheduling behavior
1. Daily report: generated each workday and additionally marked with release context when releaseDate is today.
2. Weekly report: generated weekly; if a releaseDate is in the same week, include explicit release readiness section.
3. Steering report: generated for each planned releaseDate (release-specific executive pack).

Note: exact run times will be finalized in automation configuration step.

## 5) Data Quality Rules

1. Missing required fields must be surfaced in a "Data quality issues" subsection.
2. Ambiguous ownership (assignee/team) must be flagged, not hidden.
3. Any inferred statement must be labeled as "inference".
4. Unknown values must be explicitly marked "Unknown" (never silently omitted).

## 6) Versioning

- This file is `v1` baseline.
- RAG thresholds and KPI formulas will be tightened after first production iterations.
